      "description": "Our team was recently engaged to redo the homepage of the Nissan USA website, and I implemented the vehicle selection component that appears at the top. It is designed to use large images and dynamic animations to showcase the vehicles, and catch the user's eye as they arrive on the page. As the leading element on a highly-trafficked page, loading speed was a key concern. This component intelligently lazy loads images in priority of when the user will see them. The animation is handled by stacking the images and adjusting their z-index to minimize reflows. A clipping mask animation is then used to wipe to the selected image, creating a smooth and elegant effect.",

      "description": "An informational page for Nissan electric vehicle lineup. The page is meant to clear up misconceptions and answer questions users may have about electric vehicles. Of course, there is also a lot of information about Nissan's electric vehicle offerings, the ARIYA and the LEAF. The page is meant to evoke the traditional Nissan styling and layouts seen elsewhere on the site, with a more modern approach. I worked with a small team at my company to implement the design using React, Gatsby, Framer Motion, and Styled Components.",

      "description": "A project for Infiniti that allows the user to save aspects of vehicles that interest them (such as trim colours, interior, and even concepts such as spaciousness) as they browse the QX60 & QX80 pages. These aspects can then be viewed as a collection of cards on a data-driven page, and shared with friends, family, or an Infiniti retailer.  I was the lead front-end developer on this project",

I have added new features, fixed bugs, singlehandedly created new components (including markup, styling, and logic), and advised producers and content authors on the best usage of our library.",

      "description": "A digital art tool I programmed in Processing, a Java-based programming environment for interactive media projects. It takes an image as input, and 'redraws' it with geometric primitives. The colour of each shape is sampled from the image. Depending on what parameters the program is given, the resulting output can vary wildly. The photographs used in this project were also taken by me."
